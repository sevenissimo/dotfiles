## Key bindings

# Key bindings may be reassigned via the following command:
#   bind <key> <function> <menu>
# Rebinds the key <key> to a new <function> named function in the
# context of menu <menu>.
#
# NOTE:	The format of <key> should be one of: ^[A-Z], M-[A-Z], F[1..24]
#       Since nano 4.8 M-X can be preceded by Sh- modifier (ex. Sh-M-S)
#       But when any Sh-M bind is made, *all of them* became case sensitive
# NOTE: It's not possible to rebind/unbind ^H because its keycode
#       is identical to that of the Backspace key -.-
